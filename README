  About
=========

This is a small D-Bus signal generator that broadcasts a message (signal)
to the D-Bus system bus whenever a YubiKey is inserted or removed.

In the directory yubico-osd-notifier/ there is a small receiver for these
signals sent by udev/yubikey-notification (which is invoked by udev rules)
that will request an on-screen notification showing when a YubiKey is
inserted or removed.


================
  Installation
================

the package yubico-dbus-notifier available in ppa:fredrikt/yubico

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fredrikt/yubico
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install yubico-dbus-notifier
